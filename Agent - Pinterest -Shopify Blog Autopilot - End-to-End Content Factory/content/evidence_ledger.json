  "summary": "Research confirms that homemade vinegar from fruit scraps is a simple fermentation process requiring only fruit scraps, water, and sugar. The process takes 3-4 weeks total: 7-10 days with fruit scraps (stirring daily), then 2-3 weeks after straining. Key success factors include using non-chlorinated water, maintaining 65-85°F temperature, daily stirring to prevent mold, and keeping the vessel covered with cloth (not sealed) to allow oxygen while keeping pests out."
